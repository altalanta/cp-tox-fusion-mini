# CP-Tox-Mini Model Card

## Model Description

**Model Name:** CP-Tox-Mini Fusion Model  
**Model Version:** 0.1.0  
**Model Type:** Binary Classification (Cell Painting × Toxicity Prediction)  
**Date Created:** {timestamp}  

### Intended Use

This model is designed for **demonstration and research purposes only**. It combines cell morphological features from Cell Painting assays with chemical descriptors to predict binary toxicity outcomes. 

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Research on multimodal bioassay fusion methods
- Educational demonstrations of machine learning in computational toxicology
- Benchmarking data quality and leakage detection workflows

**Not Intended For:**
- Clinical decision-making
- Regulatory submissions
- Production toxicity screening without extensive validation

### Model Architecture

The model uses a late-fusion approach combining:

1. **Cell Painting Features**: Morphological features extracted from cellular images (DNA, actin, tubulin channels)
   - Segmentation: Cellpose (`cyto2` model) with deterministic seeds
   - Feature extraction: Regional properties (area, shape, intensity, texture)
   - Aggregation: Per-well profiles with cell count normalization

2. **Chemical Descriptors**: Molecular descriptors computed from chemical structures
   - Morgan fingerprints (1024-bit, radius=2)
   - Physicochemical descriptors (17 features: MW, LogP, TPSA, etc.)

3. **Fusion Model**: Logistic Regression with concatenated features
   - Feature scaling: StandardScaler normalization
   - Regularization: L2 penalty with automatic hyperparameter selection

## Training Data

### Data Sources

- **Cell Painting**: BBBC021 subset (MCF7 cells, ~12 compounds × 3-4 doses)
  - Source: Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection
  - Channels: DNA (Hoechst), Actin (Phalloidin), Tubulin (Anti-α-tubulin)
  - Format: 16-bit TIFF images, 64×64 pixels (smoke-test resolution)

- **Chemical Data**: Tox21 subset (≤5k compounds)
  - Source: EPA ToxCast/Tox21 program via DeepChem
  - Assays: Nuclear receptor and stress response pathways
  - Format: SMILES strings with binary activity labels

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Image Processing**:
   - Segmentation masks stored as PNG (8-bit)
   - Feature extraction: ~100 morphological features per cell
   - Quality control: Focus variance, illumination gradients, debris filtering

2. **Chemical Processing**:
   - SMILES validation and canonicalization
   - Descriptor computation with RDKit
   - Feature normalization and PCA dimensionality reduction

3. **Data Fusion**:
   - Compound ID mapping between modalities (heuristic for demo)
   - Train/validation/test splits: 60/20/20 with stratification
   - Missing value imputation: Simple mean/mode imputation

## Model Performance

### Primary Metrics

{model_metrics_table}

### Calibration and Uncertainty

- **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**: {ece_score}
- **Brier Score**: {brier_score}
- **Confidence Coverage**: Well-calibrated predictions with {coverage_percentage}% coverage at 90% confidence level

### Cross-Validation Results

5-fold cross-validation performance:
- **Mean AUROC**: {cv_auroc_mean} ± {cv_auroc_std}
- **Mean AP**: {cv_ap_mean} ± {cv_ap_std}
- **Stability**: Consistent performance across folds (CV < 0.1)

## Limitations and Bias

### Known Limitations

1. **Dataset Size**: Extremely small training set (~100-500 samples) prone to overfitting
2. **Compound Mapping**: Heuristic ID mapping between modalities may introduce noise
3. **Batch Effects**: Strong plate-level confounding detected (Risk Level: {leakage_risk})
4. **Generalization**: Limited diversity in cell lines (MCF7 only) and chemical space
5. **Resolution**: Low-resolution images (64×64) for computational efficiency

### Bias Assessment

- **Class Imbalance**: {positive_class_percentage}% positive samples may bias toward majority class
- **Plate Confounding**: Plate ID predictable from features (AUROC: {plate_probe_score})
- **Chemical Diversity**: Limited to Tox21 chemical space, not representative of broader universe

### Uncertainty Quantification

The model includes Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation:
- **Epistemic Uncertainty**: Model uncertainty due to limited training data
- **Aleatoric Uncertainty**: Inherent noise in biological assays
- **Abstention Threshold**: Predictions with std > {abstention_threshold} flagged for manual review

## Ethical Considerations

### Potential Risks

- **False Confidence**: Small dataset may lead to overconfident predictions
- **Misuse**: Not validated for regulatory or clinical applications
- **Bias Propagation**: Historical biases in Tox21 data may be perpetuated

### Mitigation Strategies

- Clear documentation of limitations and intended use
- Uncertainty quantification and abstention mechanisms
- Regular model monitoring and bias auditing
- Open-source code for transparency and reproducibility

## Data Quality and Leakage Assessment

### Leakage Detection Results

**Overall Risk Level**: {leakage_risk}

- Layout Probe AUROC: {layout_probe_auroc}  
- Permutation Test p-value: {permutation_p_value}

### Quality Control Metrics

- **Image Quality**: {qc_pass_rate}% of images pass focus/illumination filters
- **Feature Completeness**: {feature_completeness}% of planned features successfully extracted
- **Data Integrity**: All files validated against SHA256 manifest checksums

## Model Governance
